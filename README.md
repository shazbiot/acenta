<h4>Overview</h4>
The ‘AcentaDollar’ application will be delivered as a web application for anyone interested in staying on top of their finances and achieving their financial goals. It will provide users with the ability to record and track their income and expenses, with the option to categorise expenses which can then be visualised in reports to analyse where and how money is being spent. 
<br>
<br>
Additionally, for users looking to achieve a savings goal for items such as that all important next holiday, a savings goal feature is included in the application. This allows users to set an amount they would like to reach as a goal and a date to reach the goal. 
<br>
<br>The Savings Goal feature will create a savings plan based on the goal amount and date to provide the user with the minimum amount required to be saved each period to attain their goal, with reports available to track ongoing progress.
